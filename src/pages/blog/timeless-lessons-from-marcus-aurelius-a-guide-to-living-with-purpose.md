> "Life can end at any moment," as Marcus Aurelius once said. Let this guide everything you do, say, and think. Life is short—act as if every action or thought might be your last. Marcus Aurelius is arguably one of the most remarkable people to ever live. There's a famous saying: "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." But Marcus was the exception. He wasn’t born into royalty; he was chosen at a young age, much like Nero, to be prepared for power. But what did he do once he attained this power? He shared it with his brother.

I, Solan Voss, have been studying the life of Marcus Aurelius for over a decade since I first read his *Meditations*. This book changed my life and the lives of millions of people over the past two thousand years. Today, I’m going to share with you lessons from the one-of-a-kind philosopher-king.

### People Come First
Marcus Aurelius demonstrated his priorities during the Antonine Plague when the epidemic claimed millions of lives, and Rome's economy was in ruins. What did Marcus do? He sold off the imperial treasures to help the people. This is the example of a great leader who, in times of crisis, puts the needs of the people above his own.

### There’s Always Another Way
Stoics teach that if one door closes, another always opens. Obstacles may slow action, but they also reveal new opportunities. As Marcus Aurelius said, "What stands in the way becomes the way." We cannot control circumstances, but we can always control how we respond to them.

### Act Step by Step
We know what needs to be done, but often we put it off until tomorrow. Yet, success comes through gradual steps. Marcus Aurelius reminded us, "You could be good today, but instead, you choose tomorrow." The main problem isn’t knowledge—it’s action.

### Get Rid of Anxiety
Marcus Aurelius wrote, "I freed myself from anxiety when I realized it was within me." We often link stress to external circumstances, but its source lies within us.

### A Good Start Is Half the Battle
Marcus Aurelius would rise early and begin his day with the most important tasks. He believed that a strong start sets the tone for the entire day.

### Be Strict with Yourself
Marcus Aurelius urged us to be tolerant of others, but strict with ourselves. Self-discipline is the path to improvement, but it should be applied to oneself, not others.

### Don’t Hold Grudges Against People
Marcus Aurelius understood that people could disappoint you, but in that disappointment lie valuable lessons. Use them to become better.

### Ask Yourself: Does It Matter?
Marcus Aurelius advised, "Ask yourself: is this necessary?" Most of what we do is insignificant. Focus on what truly matters.

### Remember These Mantras

- **Amor Fati** — everything that happens, happens for you, not against you.  
- **Life is about character and actions for the benefit of others.**  
- **Memento Mori** — remember death, and act as if every action is your last.

These lessons can be applied starting today.
